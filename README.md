## Google optimization tools
##### Google [1] supports operational research tools (or-tools) for developers/researchers in order to help solving the optimization problems. We can solve the problems with different solvers such as CPLEX, GUROBI, etc., as well as various algorithms such as TSP, maxflow, mincostflow, etc. and many more tools for solving different problems. In this work, I implemented my algorithms by taking advantage of these tools and using 'python' for coding.
